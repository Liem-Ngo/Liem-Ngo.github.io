## Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) where each connection has an associated weight. The basic flow in a neural network involves:

1.  **Forward Propagation**: Input data passes through the network layers to produce an output.
2.  **Loss Calculation**: The output is compared with the actual target to compute the loss.
3.  **Backpropagation**: The network adjusts the weights to minimize the loss.
