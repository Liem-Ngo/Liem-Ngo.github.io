# Basis Deep Learning Workshop

*13 June 2024*

## Introduction

Our deep learning workshop includes core concepts with hands-on PyTorch experience. Youâ€™ll dive into Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) basics, focusing on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Explore astrophysics applications and participate in interactive Q&A sessions. Learn about forward and backward passes, layers, activation functions, and loss calculation. Engage in practical exercises, such as fitting a sine function in Google Colab, and discover Tensor Playground to visualize tensor operations.
