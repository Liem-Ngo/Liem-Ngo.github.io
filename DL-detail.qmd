# 1. Initialize the weights and biases

In deep learning, initializing weights and biases appropriately is crucial for the performance and convergence of neural networks. Here's a more detailed look at the initialization process for both weights and biases:

## Weights Initialization

-   **Random Initialization**: Weights are typically initialized randomly. This helps in breaking the symmetry and ensures that neurons in different layers learn different features.

### Purpose of Small Initial Weights

-   **Avoid Exploding/Vanishing Activations**: Large weights can cause activations to grow exponentially (exploding), while small weights can cause activations to shrink exponentially (vanishing), both hindering learning.

-   **Break Symmetry**: Random initialization breaks the symmetry where all neurons compute the same gradient, allowing them to learn different features.

-   **Gradient Flow**: Proper scaling helps maintain healthy gradient flow during backpropagation, preventing gradients from exploding or vanishing.
