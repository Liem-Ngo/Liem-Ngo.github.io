## Machine learning (ML)

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to learn from experience and act automatically. ML algorithms can be broadly classified into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training ML algorithms on labeled datasets where both input and output parameters are known. The goal is to develop a regression or classification model that can be used on new datasets to generate predictions or draw conclusions. Supervised learning algorithms learn to map input features to output labels, allowing them to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

Examples of supervised learning algorithms include:

1.  **Linear Regression**: A simple algorithm used to map the linear relationship between input features and a continuous target variable.
2.  **Logistic Regression**: An extension of linear regression used for classification tasks to estimate the likelihood that an instance belongs to a specific class.
3.  **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: Supervised learning algorithms that can perform classification and regression tasks by finding a hyperplane that best separates classes in feature space.
4.  **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric technique used for classification as well as regression by identifying the k most similar data points to a new data point and predicting the label of the new data point using the labels of those data points.
5.  **Decision Trees**: A type of supervised learning technique used for classification as well as regression by segmenting the data into smaller and smaller groups until each group can be classified or predicted with high degree of accuracy.
6.  **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that employs a set of decision trees to make predictions by aggregating predictions from individual trees.
7.  **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ theorem used for classification tasks by assuming that the features of a data point are independent of each other.
